## Ideation
We plan to build a simple, user-friendly app to help college students budget and track their spending throughout the school year. On the home page, the user will be able to see their spending for the week as well as how much more money they are allowed to spend to stay within budget. They will also be able to view a list of all their transactions for the week and will be able to categorize these purchases into different spending categories. This way, the user can see what they need to reduce spending on (restaurants, school supplies, video games, etc). They can also easily add any purchases they have made to the app, which will get automatically added to an informative spending list. The main goal of this app is to help young college students adjust their spending habits as they adapt to a brand-new environment. 

## Stakeholders

### Blake Lim
Blake Lim is a 20 year old student at New York University. Ever since arriving in the city, he has been struggling with overspending. Being in one of the most expensive cities in the country, it is difficult for him to adapt to a frugal lifestyle, especially when his close friends go out and spend money frequently. Jay has spent almost his entire savings throughout his freshman and sophomore years and needs to save what he has left until he starts working again this upcoming summer. His main goal is to track his spending and save as much money as possible. \
#### Goals/needs
- Need a list view of all transactions for the day/week/month
- Need a page where they can see how much more money they can spend for the week
- Need an interactive interface where they can add new transactions with ease

#### Problems/frustrations
- Difficult to use a single mobile banking app, as there are multiple accounts and zelle/venmo doesn't show up well
- Has the fear of not being able to fit in and feels pressure to go out with his friends on weekends
- Thinks they are saving money well, but lose track of finances throughout stressful school weeks

## Product Vision Statement

We aim to develop a student budget tracker that simplifies financial management, promoting responsible spending and empowering users to achieve their academic goals.
