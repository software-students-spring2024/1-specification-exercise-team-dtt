## Stakeholders

### Blake Lim
Blake Lim is a 20 year old student at New York University. Ever since arriving in the city, he has been struggling with overspending. Being in one of the most expensive cities in the country, it is difficult for him to adapt to a frugal lifestyle, especially when his close friends go out and spend money frequently. Jay has spent almost his entire savings throughout his freshman and sophomore years and needs to save what he has left until he starts working again this upcoming summer. His main goal is to track his spending and save as much money as possible. \
# Goals/needs
- Need a list view of all transactions and incomes, and how they sum up for each month, to intuitively see how much one spent

# Problems/frustrations
- Difficult to use a single mobile banking app, as there are multiple accounts and zelle/venmo doesn't show up well
