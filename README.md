## Stakeholders

### Blake Lim
Blake Lim is a 20 year old student at New York University. Ever since arriving in the city, he has been struggling with overspending. Being in one of the most expensive cities in the country, it is difficult for him to adapt to a frugal lifestyle, especially when his close friends go out and spend money frequently. Jay has spent almost his entire savings throughout his freshman and sophomore years and needs to save what he has left until he starts working again this upcoming summer. His main goal is to track his spending and save as much money as possible. \
#### Goals/needs
- Need a list view of all transactions for the day/week/month
- Need a page where they can see how much more money they can spend for the week
- Need an interactive interface where they can add new transactions with ease

#### Problems/frustrations
- Difficult to use a single mobile banking app, as there are multiple accounts and zelle/venmo doesn't show up well
- Has the fear of not being able to fit in and feels pressure to go out with his friends on weekends
- Thinks they are saving money well, but lose track of finances throughout stressful school weeks
